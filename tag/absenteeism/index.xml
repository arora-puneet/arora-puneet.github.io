We test whether a competitive attendance game, incentivized by non-monetary rewards, improves attendance. We randomly assign 216 classrooms, at a not-for-profit educational institute in India, into control and two treatment arms (varying in number of competitors). We find the largest impact of the treatment for students who simultaneously attend a traditional school (4.2 pp. increase in attendance), in addition to the not-for-profit, with higher effects for males (5.4 pp. higher). Moreover, the magnitude of the effect is higher (i) when students compete in small groups within their classroom as opposed to the entire class and (ii) in the second half of the term when points in the scoring system were doubled. These findings provide evidence in favor of a scalable, low out-of-pocket cost intervention that developing countries with low education budgets can adopt to counter absenteeism.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
