In Study 1, using publication data from 104 RePEc-ranked economics journals (October 2020–March 2021), we find that 74% of female economists (vs. 19% of male) coauthor in male-dominated teams, settings where attribution ambiguity may exacerbate evaluative bias. In Study 2, a randomized survey experiment (N = 233) with female economists shows that exposure to empirical evidence on attribution bias significantly shifts coauthorship preferences toward female-dominated teams, especially among early-career researchers. A follow-up survey (N = 54) indicates that the intervention provided new information, retained for months, that influenced how participants think about coauthorship strategically. These findings suggest that integrating attribution-bias awareness into mentoring and professional development, particularly for early-career scholars, can promote strategic coauthorship choices, enhance individual visibility, and help address the leaky pipeline reinforced by evaluative bias, much like the advice for Ph.D. candidates to produce solo-authored job market papers to signal individual ability.","tags":["gender bias"],"title":"Coauthorship Strategies and Gender Bias (with I.Tripathi and K.

In Study 1, we investigate the beliefs of Czech inmates  (N=297) about trust and altruism by the general public to them while varying if their prison identity is revealed, using an incentivized lab-in-the-field experiment. We find strong evidence of optimism bias in anticipated altruism. Furthermore, we examine the causal impact of a self-affirmation intervention but find no significant effects on any of the outcomes. In Study 2 (N=489), we conceptually replicate the optimism bias in altruism and identify the likely underlying mechanism to be the perception that the public sympathizes with their experiences of prison hardships and the ambiguity about the crime they committed. The overoptimism dissipates in a more dynamic setting when directly questioned. Our findings underscore the importance of addressing optimism bias in stigma expectations to improve the effectiveness of reintegration programs for inmates.","tags":[null],"title":"Anticipated Stigma among Prison Inmates- Incentivized Field Evidence (with L.

A novel incentive-based intervention (Reward treatment) provides suggestive evidence that increasing the cost of biased decisions can reduce taste-based discrimination.

Other than ability and prior preparation, student performance reflects their intrinsic motivation to do well on the test, affecting their effort on the test itself. We experimentally increase the numerosity (magnitude) of maximum points on the test to create an illusion of a more rewarding test and nudge students to exert higher effort on the test. Tested in three different settings, we find insignificant treatment effects in the high-stake test context (Setting 1) and low-stake test context (Setting 2) when an incorrect response does not attract a negative penalty. However, in a high-stake test context, when an incorrect response attracts a penalty  (Setting 3), we find the likelihood of getting the question correct increases by 9.5 pp, with stronger effects on male (16 pp) and above-median ability (16 pp) students.

In a framed lab experiment within the context of incentivized investment decisions, participants engaged in conversations of varying nature (bearish, bullish, placebo) and considered different time frames for investment returns (1 year or both 1 and 5 years). We find that both bearish and bullish conversations decreased the likelihood of investing in risky assets, with a stronger effect on moderately risky assets. The unexpected conservative investment behavior observed in response to bullish conversations was predominantly driven by female participants. Additionally, incorporating a longer-term perspective on investment returns increased the likelihood and average investments in risky assets, hinting at a potential mitigating mechanism for the stock market participation puzzle.","tags":["investments"],"title":"Conversations and Investment - An experimental study (with G.

This paper discusses the role that institutional quality plays in determining government’s effectiveness in delivering public goods and in, therefore, mediating the effects of higher taxation in an economy. A simple theoretical model shows that provision of public goods and optimal tax levels increase with improved institutional quality. Using firm-level perceptions data on the quality of public services and the tax burden, consistent with the predictions of our model, we find that a higher level of institutional quality bolsters positive perception of the quality of public services while at the same time moderating the view of the taxes as an obstacle to growth.","tags":[],"title":"Government effectiveness in the provision of public goods - the role of institutional quality","type":"publication"}]
