We compare subjects' stated preference ranking with an experimentally induced optimal ranking over three loan plan options that differ in annual percentage rate (APR), equal monthly installment (EMI), and tenure. Our findings suggest that an average subject is 78% likely to state a suboptimal preference ordering, 68% likely to select a dominated loan plan, and 36% likely to select the worst loan plan. We attribute such suboptimal decision-making to the anchoring heuristic, with APR and total cost (TC) as anchors. We also find evidence of the framing effect, with subjects switching their choice of anchor as the loan information frame changes. We discuss the heterogeneity of our findings across groups based on gender, ability, and financial knowledge.","tags":["preference reversal"],"title":"Dominated Loan Choice, Anchoring and Framing Effect (with K.

Offering pecuniary and non-pecuniary incentives may be effective in increasing such effort but often not feasible. Increasing the maximum points assigned to the test may be a supposedly irrelevant factor that can frame it as more valued, and nudge students to exert more effort on the test. Using a natural field experiment, we randomly assign 1235 students to a test framed as either carrying maximum 20-points or 100-points, and study its impact in both high-stake (comprising non-risky and one risky question) and low-stake (comprising only non-risky questions) test settings. While we find a small and statistically insignificant average treatment effect in both settings, we find positive treatment effects (1) among lower ability students in a low-stake test, (2) among higher ability students in a high-stake test only when the question carries the risk of a negative penalty. We discuss increased mental effort as the mechanism driving these effects.","tags":["Effort, Incentives, Framing Effect, Nudge, Experiment"],"title":"Maximum Points, Test Scores and Effort on the Test - Evidence from a Natural Field Experiment (with I.

We test whether a competitive attendance game, incentivized by non-monetary rewards, improves attendance. We randomly assign 216 classrooms, at a not-for-profit educational institute in India, into control and two treatment arms (varying in number of competitors). We find the largest impact of the treatment for students who simultaneously attend a traditional school (4.2 pp. increase in attendance), in addition to the not-for-profit, with higher effects for males (5.4 pp. higher). Moreover, the magnitude of the effect is higher (i) when students compete in small groups within their classroom as opposed to the entire class and (ii) in the second half of the term when points in the scoring system were doubled. These findings provide evidence in favor of a scalable, low out-of-pocket cost intervention that developing countries with low education budgets can adopt to counter absenteeism.","tags":["absenteeism"],"title":"Can rank-based non-monetary rewards improve student attendance?

This group accountability (GA) in the audit mechanism introduces an externality where one's action affects the likelihood of others being audited. It can induce a different tax compliance behavior compared to the individual accountability (IA) audit mechanism, where an individual is selected randomly for audit. We study the effectiveness of GA against IA treatment using a lab experiment, and find that GA treatment increases the mean tax compliance by 6.6 pp (intensive margin) and full tax compliance rate by 12.7 pp (extensive margin). We also report how this impact changes as we vary the audit rate, group size and degree of anonymity among group members.","tags":["tax evasion"],"title":"Group Accountability and Tax Compliance (with S.

However, misaligned expectations may influence students' effort decision and adversely impact their academic outcomes. In this study, we asked students to sign an academic pledge to work towards their preferred grade in an introductory economics course and to identify the actions they will take to achieve the targeted grade. While treated students pledged a greater time commitment and higher targeted grade, we find that the intervention decreased their overall test score by 0.23 standard deviations and reduced the likelihood of passing the course by 14 percentage points. We believe that disappointment with their inability to attain their grossly overestimated target is one plausible justification for these results.","tags":["pledge"],"title":"I Promise to Work Hard - The Impact of Written Pledges on Student Performance (with N.

This paper discusses the role that institutional quality plays in determining government’s effectiveness in delivering public goods and in, therefore, mediating the effects of higher taxation in an economy. A simple theoretical model shows that provision of public goods and optimal tax levels increase with improved institutional quality. Using firm-level perceptions data on the quality of public services and the tax burden, consistent with the predictions of our model, we find that a higher level of institutional quality bolsters positive perception of the quality of public services while at the same time moderating the view of the taxes as an obstacle to growth.","tags":[],"title":"Government effectiveness in the provision of public goods - the role of institutional quality","type":"publication"}]
