We do not find baseline evidence of gender bias, however, when we provide additional information about a professor's credentials, we find that female professors receive better ratings on average. Further, on receiving additional information, female students give higher ratings to female professors and lower ratings to male professors. Our findings suggest that gender discrimination is context-dependent and provide evidence of a novel information mechanism's efficacy to mitigate it.","tags":["tax evasion"],"title":"Gender Gap in Teaching Evaluations -Experimental Evidence from India (with M.

While prior studies hint at the anchoring role of APR and Total Cost in such decisions, it is unclear whether subjects can cognitively select an optimal loan. Using a laboratory experiment, I find subjects to be 78% likely to state a suboptimal preference ordering and 68% likely to select a dominated loan plan. I find associational evidence on the use of APR or Total Cost (TC) anchors and causal evidence of framing effect bias with subjects switching their choice of the anchor as the loan information frame changes. These findings raise serious questions about an individual's understanding of loan-related attributes and thrust the need for education programs to build citizens' financial capability.","tags":["preference reversal"],"title":"Loan Choice, Anchoring and Framing Effect (Under Review)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662768e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662768e3,"objectID":"4fd763b90a82dfa34b34bdb6f53f828b","permalink":"https://arora-puneet.github.io/project/saliency/","publishdate":"2022-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/saliency/","section":"project","summary":"Assessment tests are used extensively to measure student learning. Other than ability and prior preparation, student performance reflects their intrinsic motivation to do well on the test, affecting their effort on the test itself. We experimentally increase the numerosity (magnitude) of maximum points on the test to create an illusion of a more rewarding test and nudge students to exert higher effort on the test. Tested in three different settings, we find insignificant treatment effects in the high-stake test context (Setting 1) and low-stake test context (Setting 2) when an incorrect response does not attract a negative penalty. However, in a high-stake test context, when an incorrect response attracts a penalty  (Setting 3), we find the likelihood of getting the question correct increases by 9.5 pp, with stronger effects on male (16 pp) and above-median ability (16 pp) students. We discuss increasing mental effort as the potential mechanism driving the effects.","tags":["Effort, Incentives, Framing Effect, Nudge, Experiment"],"title":"Maximum Points, Test Scores and Effort on the Test Itself (with I.

We test whether a competitive attendance game, incentivized by non-monetary rewards, improves attendance. We randomly assign 216 classrooms, at a not-for-profit educational institute in India, into control and two treatment arms (varying in number of competitors). We find the largest impact of the treatment for students who simultaneously attend a traditional school (4.2 pp. increase in attendance), in addition to the not-for-profit, with higher effects for males (5.4 pp. higher). Moreover, the magnitude of the effect is higher (i) when students compete in small groups within their classroom as opposed to the entire class and (ii) in the second half of the term when points in the scoring system were doubled. These findings provide evidence in favor of a scalable, low out-of-pocket cost intervention that developing countries with low education budgets can adopt to counter absenteeism.","tags":["absenteeism"],"title":"Can rank-based non-monetary rewards improve student attendance?

This group accountability (GA) in the audit mechanism introduces an externality where one's action affects the likelihood of others being audited. It can induce a different tax compliance behavior compared to the individual accountability (IA) audit mechanism, where an individual is selected randomly for audit. We study the effectiveness of GA against IA treatment using a lab experiment, and find that GA treatment increases the mean tax compliance by 6.6 pp (intensive margin) and full tax compliance rate by 12.7 pp (extensive margin). We also report how this impact changes as we vary the audit rate, group size and degree of anonymity among group members.","tags":["tax evasion"],"title":"Group Accountability and Tax Compliance (with S.

This paper discusses the role that institutional quality plays in determining government’s effectiveness in delivering public goods and in, therefore, mediating the effects of higher taxation in an economy. A simple theoretical model shows that provision of public goods and optimal tax levels increase with improved institutional quality. Using firm-level perceptions data on the quality of public services and the tax burden, consistent with the predictions of our model, we find that a higher level of institutional quality bolsters positive perception of the quality of public services while at the same time moderating the view of the taxes as an obstacle to growth.","tags":[],"title":"Government effectiveness in the provision of public goods - the role of institutional quality","type":"publication"}]
