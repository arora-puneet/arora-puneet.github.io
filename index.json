Some instructors use goal-inducing non-binding commitment pledges to nudge students to follow through on their intended course of action. Using a field experiment, we asked treated students to set a goal grade, identify the actions they will take to achieve it, and sign a commitment pledge to work towards this grade. We find that while treated students pledged a greater time commitment and targeted a higher grade, their overall test scores decrease by 0.23 standard deviations and they were 15 percentage points less likely to pass the course.","tags":["pledge"],"title":"I Promise to Work Hard - The Impact of Written Pledges on Student Performance (with N.

We employ a novel experimental design, randomly assigning 504 economics students to an identical audiovisual class taught either in a female or male voice. We find no significant differences in ratings given between female or male professors across any teaching dimension. However, when additional information about a professor's professional accomplishments is provided, female professors receive higher ratings on average. The effect comes mainly from female students, who increase the ratings of female professors and lower the ratings of male professors. Our findings suggest that gender bias is context-dependent and provide evidence of the effectiveness of an information mechanism that can help shift perceptions about female professors.","tags":["tax evasion"],"title":"Are Students Really Biased against Female Professors?

Previous studies have hinted at the anchoring role of Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and Total Cost (TC) of the loan plan in such decisions, however, it is unclear whether subjects can cognitively select an optimal loan. Through a framed laboratory experiment, I found that subjects were 78% likely to state a suboptimal preference ordering and 68% likely to select a dominated loan plan. There is associational evidence on the use of APR or Total Cost (TC) anchors, and causal evidence of framing effect bias, with subjects switching their choice of the anchor as the loan information frame changed. These findings pose serious questions about an individual’s understanding of loan-related attributes and emphasize the need for education programs to build citizens’ financial capability.","tags":["preference reversal"],"title":"Loan Choice, Anchoring and Framing Effect","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662768e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662768e3,"objectID":"4fd763b90a82dfa34b34bdb6f53f828b","permalink":"https://arora-puneet.github.io/project/saliency/","publishdate":"2022-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/saliency/","section":"project","summary":"Assessment tests are used extensively to measure student learning. Other than ability and prior preparation, student performance reflects their intrinsic motivation to do well on the test, affecting their effort on the test itself. We experimentally increase the numerosity (magnitude) of maximum points on the test to create an illusion of a more rewarding test and nudge students to exert higher effort on the test. Tested in three different settings, we find insignificant treatment effects in the high-stake test context (Setting 1) and low-stake test context (Setting 2) when an incorrect response does not attract a negative penalty. However, in a high-stake test context, when an incorrect response attracts a penalty  (Setting 3), we find the likelihood of getting the question correct increases by 9.5 pp, with stronger effects on male (16 pp) and above-median ability (16 pp) students. We discuss increasing mental effort as the potential mechanism driving the effects.","tags":["Effort, Incentives, Framing Effect, Nudge, Experiment"],"title":"Maximum Points, Test Scores and Effort on the Test Itself (with I.

This group accountability (GA) in the audit mechanism introduces an externality where one's action affects the likelihood of others being audited. It can induce a different tax compliance behavior compared to the individual accountability (IA) audit mechanism, where an individual is selected randomly for audit. We study the effectiveness of GA against IA treatment using a lab experiment, and find that GA treatment increases the mean tax compliance by 6.6 pp (intensive margin) and full tax compliance rate by 12.7 pp (extensive margin). We also report how this impact changes as we vary the audit rate, group size and degree of anonymity among group members.","tags":["tax evasion"],"title":"Group Accountability and Tax Compliance (with S.

This paper discusses the role that institutional quality plays in determining government’s effectiveness in delivering public goods and in, therefore, mediating the effects of higher taxation in an economy. A simple theoretical model shows that provision of public goods and optimal tax levels increase with improved institutional quality. Using firm-level perceptions data on the quality of public services and the tax burden, consistent with the predictions of our model, we find that a higher level of institutional quality bolsters positive perception of the quality of public services while at the same time moderating the view of the taxes as an obstacle to growth.","tags":[],"title":"Government effectiveness in the provision of public goods - the role of institutional quality","type":"publication"}]
