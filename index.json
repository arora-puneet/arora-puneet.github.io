We test whether a competitive attendance game, incentivized by non-monetary rewards, improves attendance. We randomly assign 216 classrooms, at a not-for-profit educational institute in India, into control and two treatment arms (varying in number of competitors). We find the largest impact of the treatment for students who simultaneously attend a traditional school (4.2 pp. increase in attendance), in addition to the not-for-profit, with higher effects for males (5.4 pp. higher). Moreover, the magnitude of the effect is higher (i) when students compete in small groups within their classroom as opposed to the entire class and (ii) in the second half of the term when points in the scoring system were doubled. These findings provide evidence in favor of a scalable, low out-of-pocket cost intervention that developing countries with low education budgets can adopt to counter absenteeism.","tags":["absenteeism"],"title":"Competitive Games to Nudge Students - Experimental Evidence from India (with T.

As a result, it is important to develop a cost-efficient audit strategy that deters tax evasion. One of the methods the IRS uses to select tax returns for audits is to pick individuals who are engaged in transactions with other taxpayers whose tax returns were selected for audit. This joint liability in the audit mechanism introduces an externality where one’s action affects the likelihood of others being audited. Therefore, it can induce different tax compliance behavior compared to an individual liability audit mechanism. We study the effectiveness of this Group Accountability (GA) audit mechanism against a purely random selection Individual Accountability (IA) audit mechanism using a lab experiment. In the GA audit mechanism, taxpayers are exogenously combined into several groups. When one person in the group is randomly selected for audit and found to be cheating on taxes, then all members of the group are also audited. Our results show that tax compliance is higher in the GA audit mechanism compared to the IA audit mechanism in both cases when group members are and not anonymous.","tags":["tax evasion"],"title":"Group accountability and tax evasion (with S.

However, misaligned expectations may influence students' effort decision and adversely impact their academic outcomes. In this study, we asked students to sign an academic pledge to work towards their preferred grade in an introductory economics course and to identify the actions they will take to achieve the targeted grade. While treated students pledged a greater time commitment and higher targeted grade, we find that the intervention decreased their overall test score by 0.23 standard deviations and reduced the likelihood of passing the course by 14 percentage points. We believe that disappointment with their inability to attain their grossly overestimated target is one plausible justification for these results. - Under Review","tags":["pledge"],"title":"I Promise to Work Hard - The Impact of Written Pledges on Student Performance (with N.
