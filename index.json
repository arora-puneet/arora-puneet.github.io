We test whether a competitive attendance game, incentivized by non-monetary rewards, improves attendance. We randomly assign 216 classrooms, at a not-for-profit educational institute in India, into control and two treatment arms (varying in number of competitors). We find the largest impact of the treatment for students who simultaneously attend a traditional school (4.2 pp. increase in attendance), in addition to the not-for-profit, with higher effects for males (5.4 pp. higher). Moreover, the magnitude of the effect is higher (i) when students compete in small groups within their classroom as opposed to the entire class and (ii) in the second half of the term when points in the scoring system were doubled. These findings provide evidence in favor of a scalable, low out-of-pocket cost intervention that developing countries with low education budgets can adopt to counter absenteeism.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://arora-puneet.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"Experimental Evidence from India","tags":["absenteeism"],"title":"Competitive Games to Nudge Students","type":"project"},{"authors":["Puneet Arora","Ishtiaque Fazlul","Tareena Musaddiq"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"bab0580adf9e34f72e24d73a74f86903","permalink":"https://arora-puneet.github.io/publication/ael22/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ael22/","section":"publication","summary":"Third-generation DNA sequencing technologies such as single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) and nanopore sequencing have the potential to fill the gaps in the existing genome databases since the raw sequences produced by these machines are much longer than those of previous generations and therefore result in more contiguous assemblies.
