However, it is unclear whether they can select the most cost-effective plan. Through a framed laboratory experiment, I found that participants were 78\\% likely to state a suboptimal preference ordering and 68\\% likely to select a dominated loan plan. I provide suggestive evidence on the role of attribute substitution in the decision making process, where participants substituted APR and Total Cost attributes for the present discounted cost of a loan plan. Additionally, I provide causal evidence demonstrating how additional information can alter the choice of the substituted attribute. These findings raise important questions about individuals' comprehension of loan-related attributes and emphasize the need for education programs to build citizens’ financial capability.","tags":["Experiment"],"title":"Loan Selection, Attribute Substitution and Information Effect - R\u0026R (Review of Behavioral Finance)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662768e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662768e3,"objectID":"4fd763b90a82dfa34b34bdb6f53f828b","permalink":"https://arora-puneet.github.io/project/saliency/","publishdate":"2022-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/saliency/","section":"project","summary":"Assessment tests are used extensively to measure student learning. Other than ability and prior preparation, student performance reflects their intrinsic motivation to do well on the test, affecting their effort on the test itself.

Tested in three different settings, we find insignificant treatment effects in the high-stake test context (Setting 1) and low-stake test context (Setting 2) when an incorrect response does not attract a negative penalty. However, in a high-stake test context, when an incorrect response attracts a penalty  (Setting 3), we find the likelihood of getting the question correct increases by 9.5 pp, with stronger effects on male (16 pp) and above-median ability (16 pp) students.

This group accountability (GA) in the audit mechanism introduces an externality where one's action affects the likelihood of others being audited. It can induce a different tax compliance behavior compared to the individual accountability (IA) audit mechanism, where an individual is selected randomly for audit. We study the effectiveness of GA against IA treatment using a lab experiment, and find that GA treatment increases the mean tax compliance by 6.6 pp (intensive margin) and full tax compliance rate by 12.7 pp (extensive margin).

In a framed lab experiment within the context of incentivized investment decisions, participants engaged in conversations of varying nature (bearish, bullish, placebo) and considered different time frames for investment returns (1 year or both 1 and 5 years). We find that both bearish and bullish conversations decreased the likelihood of investing in risky assets, with a stronger effect on moderately risky assets. The unexpected conservative investment behavior observed in response to bullish conversations was predominantly driven by female participants. Additionally, incorporating a longer-term perspective on investment returns increased the likelihood and average investments in risky assets, hinting at a potential mitigating mechanism for the stock market participation puzzle.","tags":["investments"],"title":"Conversations and Investment - An experimental study (with G.

This paper discusses the role that institutional quality plays in determining government’s effectiveness in delivering public goods and in, therefore, mediating the effects of higher taxation in an economy. A simple theoretical model shows that provision of public goods and optimal tax levels increase with improved institutional quality. Using firm-level perceptions data on the quality of public services and the tax burden, consistent with the predictions of our model, we find that a higher level of institutional quality bolsters positive perception of the quality of public services while at the same time moderating the view of the taxes as an obstacle to growth.","tags":[],"title":"Government effectiveness in the provision of public goods - the role of institutional quality","type":"publication"}]
