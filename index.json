Some instructors use goal-inducing non-binding commitment pledges to nudge students to follow through on their intended course of action.

We find that while treated students pledged a greater time commitment and targeted a higher grade, their overall test scores decrease by 0.23 standard deviations and they were 15 percentage points less likely to pass the course.","tags":["pledge"],"title":"I Promise to Work Hard - The Impact of Written Pledges on Student Performance (with N.

Other than ability and prior preparation, student performance reflects their intrinsic motivation to do well on the test, affecting their effort on the test itself. We experimentally increase the numerosity (magnitude) of maximum points on the test to create an illusion of a more rewarding test and nudge students to exert higher effort on the test. Tested in three different settings, we find insignificant treatment effects in the high-stake test context (Setting 1) and low-stake test context (Setting 2) when an incorrect response does not attract a negative penalty. However, in a high-stake test context, when an incorrect response attracts a penalty  (Setting 3), we find the likelihood of getting the question correct increases by 9.5 pp, with stronger effects on male (16 pp) and above-median ability (16 pp) students. We discuss increasing mental effort as the potential mechanism driving the effects.","tags":["Effort, Incentives, Framing Effect, Nudge, Experiment"],"title":"Maximum Points, Test Scores and Effort on the Test Itself (with I.

In a framed lab experiment within the context of incentivized investment decisions, participants engaged in conversations of varying nature (bearish, bullish, placebo) and considered different time frames for investment returns (1 year or both 1 and 5 years). We find that both bearish and bullish conversations decreased the likelihood of investing in risky assets, with a stronger effect on moderately risky assets. The unexpected conservative investment behavior observed in response to bullish conversations was predominantly driven by female participants. Additionally, incorporating a longer-term perspective on investment returns increased the likelihood and average investments in risky assets, hinting at a potential mitigating mechanism for the stock market participation puzzle.","tags":["investments"],"title":"Conversations and Investment - An experimental study (with G.

This paper discusses the role that institutional quality plays in determining government’s effectiveness in delivering public goods and in, therefore, mediating the effects of higher taxation in an economy. A simple theoretical model shows that provision of public goods and optimal tax levels increase with improved institutional quality. Using firm-level perceptions data on the quality of public services and the tax burden, consistent with the predictions of our model, we find that a higher level of institutional quality bolsters positive perception of the quality of public services while at the same time moderating the view of the taxes as an obstacle to growth.","tags":[],"title":"Government effectiveness in the provision of public goods - the role of institutional quality","type":"publication"}]
